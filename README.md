We employed the K-means technique for data point clustering to image compression in this project. Initially, we put into practice the functions that calculated the centroid means and located the closest centroids for every data point. Next, we used a sample dataset to apply K-means, and we plotted the algorithm's output. For centroids, we also used random initialization in order to prevent less-than-ideal results. Lastly, we used K-means to compress an image by lowering its color palette from thousands to sixteen. In this way, we reduced the number of bits needed to represent the image by assigning each pixel to the nearest centroid. The rebuilt image kept the majority of the original's features, but the smaller color palette made some compression artifacts obvious. In general, the compression method produced a compression ratio.
